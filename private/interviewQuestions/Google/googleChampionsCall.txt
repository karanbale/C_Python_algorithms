5 interviews
1 behavioral round
senior role: sys/ design
rest all coding

questions close/related to experience

prep:
leetcode
prog language choose it wisely
- you should know it well, in and out
- go to websites and solve questions in your language
- practice in your language
- only have 45 mins
- 30-35mins for questions
- time yourself
- write and start over => waste of time
- depends on interviewer
	easy to complicated
	
- dont assume
- ask enough questions
- understand problem
- think about testing / corner cases
- ask for e.g.
- enumerate test cases 
- try not to be nervous
- communication is key
- 

s/s design
- may not write code
- being asked to senior question
- typical e.g. of s/s designs look up on leetcode
- look up e.g. pertaining to your domain
- distributed 
- go top down, higher level to deep down
- trade offs, gotchas, to be considered
- may give you a flow and ask to fix problems in it

be comfortable with your language
if you’re experienced coding should not be a problem
writing and erasing => red line
first explain the algorithm and then write the code
- interviewer can help you out
senior candidates (L5) IC
communication not good? => red flag
may feedback that he’s not good for L5 but good for L4

HAVE SENSE OF TIME, so you can finish in time.
good to have algorithm first , verify and test with examples
and then code 
Write generic case algorithm first and then start writing corner cases after perfecting generic cases
writing corner case first? => red flag (why?) because you have not evolved generic case all the way to understand corner cases
