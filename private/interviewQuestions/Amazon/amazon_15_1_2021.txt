Round 1:

Given an array of tree nodes (randomly placed), write a function to find out if this tree
is a valid tree or not.
==> Assume all nodes are unique and positive.
==> how can you find parent node from this list?

What is one of the coolest thing you've professionally implemented recently?

Round 2:

Given a matrix of NxN size:
=> You can only travel in (x+1, y) and (x, y+1) directions i.e. right and left. 
==> all values in the matrix are positive integers.
==> Travel in this matrix in the order given above and return the total sum at each index.
Then return the maximum sum amongst all these sums and return that as a total reward.

Round 3:

==> Leadership principles (60 minutes)
==> You received a critical feedback about your work, how did you deal with it?

Round 4:

==> Tell me about a time, where you had to deliver a project and how did you achieve it?
==> String encoding and decoding 

Round 5:

==> Leadership principles and SSD related questions
==> Describe how does a read / write works in an SSD. Give me a flow of this command.
==> System design:
    ==> Design a task scheduler
