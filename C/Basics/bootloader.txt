As a minimum, bootloaders must supply the following: 
a communication channel, a method to erase and reprogram Flash memory, 
and a method to validate and execute newly programmed application code.

Additionally, a bootloader should be able to detect, report, and handle errors that occur during the bootload operation, 
such as power failure, loss of communication, and Flash write error. 
Flash error protection is usually done by storing a checksum or Cyclic Redundancy Code (CRC) for the application.
