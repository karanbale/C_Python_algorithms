Binary Search Tree NOTES:

1. A BST is a complete tree if all its nodes are filled, from let to right, 
2. If you represent a complete tree in an array, you should not find any empty elements in the array.
All elements must be filled.
                A
        B               C
    D       E       F       G

e.g. A,B,C,D,E,F,G => this is a complete binary tree

                A
        B               C
                    F       G
e.g. A,B,C,-,-,F,G => this is NOT a complete binary tree
