Odd and Even square numbers
Squares of even numbers are even, i.e, (2n)2 = 4n2.
Squares of odd numbers are odd, i.e, (2n + 1) = 4(n2 + n) + 1.
Since every odd square is of the form 4n + 1, the odd numbers that are of the form 4n + 3 are not square numbers.

Properties of Square Numbers
The following are the properties of the square numbers:

1. A number with 2, 3, 7 or 8 at unit’s place should never be a perfect square.
   In other words, none of the square numbers ends in 2, 3, 7 or 8.
2. If the number of zeros at the end is even, then the number is a perfect square number.
   Otherwise, we can say that number ending in an odd number of zeros is never a perfect square
3. If the even numbers are squared, it always gives even numbers.
   Also, if the odd numbers are squared, it always gives odd numbers.
4. If the natural numbers other than one is squared, it should be either a multiple of 3 or exceeds a multiple of 3 by 1.
5. If the natural numbers other than one is squared, it should be either a multiple of 4 or exceeds a multiple of 4 by 1.
6. It is noted that the unit’s digit of the square of a natural number is equal to,
   the unit’s digit of the square of the digit at unit’s place of the given natural number.
7. There are n natural numbers, say p and q such that p**2 = 2q**2
8. For every natural number n, we can write it as: (n + 1) 2 – n 2 = ( n + 1) + n..
9. If a number n is squared, it equals to the sum of first n odd natural numbers.
10. For any natural number, say”n” which is greater than 1, we can say that (2n, n 2 – 1, n 2 + 1) should be,
    a Pythagorean triplet.
