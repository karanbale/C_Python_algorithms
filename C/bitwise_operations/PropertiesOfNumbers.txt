Property to remember: 
    Number and its negative representation,
    both will always have right most set bit of the number set, all other 
    bits will be flipped.

Property of numbers who are power of 2:
    Only 1 bit will be set for numbers, who are power of 2.

Theory of operation for negative numbers:
    To save negative numbers, we flip all the bits of number,
    then we add 1 to it. Hence right most bit of both, will always be same.

Parity refers to the number of 1s in a given number.
Odd parity (1) means there are odd number of 1s 
Even parity (0) means there are even number of 1s

So in practice "absolute value" means to remove any negative sign in front of a number, 
and to think of all numbers as positive (or zero). NO NEGATIVES !
The absolute value of −9 is 9
The absolute value of 3 is 3
The absolute value of 0 is 0
The absolute value of −156 is 156
