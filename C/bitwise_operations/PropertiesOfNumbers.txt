Property to remember: 
    Number and its negative representation,
    both will always have right most set bit of the number set, all other 
    bits will be flipped.

Property of numbers who are power of 2:
    Only 1 bit will be set for numbers, who are power of 2.

Theory of operation for negative numbers:
    To save negative numbers, we flip all the bits of number,
    then we add 1 to it. Hence right most bit of both, will always be same.

Parity refers to the number of 1s in a given number.
Odd parity (1) means there are odd number of 1s 
Even parity (0) means there are even number of 1s

So in practice "absolute value" means to remove any negative sign in front of a number, 
and to think of all numbers as positive (or zero). NO NEGATIVES !
The absolute value of −9 is 9
The absolute value of 3 is 3
The absolute value of 0 is 0
The absolute value of −156 is 156

Property, for even numbers, LSB is always 0.
Simply check LSB. 
If LSB = 1, number is odd.
if LSB = 0, number is even.


We right shift or left shift the number as step 1.
Then we compare given number with this right/left shifted number.
If outout is 0, then there are no pair with adjacent 1's.
If output is greater than 0, then there are pair with adjacent 1's.

    Number WITH adjacent pair of 1's
    Number    : 67
    Binary    : 0b01000011
    Number<<1 : 0b10000110
    ANDing O/P: 0b00000010

    Number WITHOUT adjacent pair of 1's
    Number    : 64
    Binary    : 0b01000000
    Number<<1 : 0b10000000
    ANDing O/P: 0b00000000

If you take AND of n and (n-1), we can unset right most set bit of n.
For a given number 'n', (n-1) will always have all of its bits flipped,
AFTER n's right most set bit.
    e.g.
    Number   = 0b00010100 (20)
    Number-1 = 0b00010011 (19)
    ANDing   = 0b00010000 ====> Right most bit of n was cleared.
