MCQ:
    -   A black and white computer graphics display is divided int an array of pixels.
    Each of the pixels can take on one of eight gray levels ranging from 0 to 7. 
    In order to prevent sharp discontinuities of shade, the system enforces the rule that,the gray levels of adjacent pixels cannot differ by more than 2. 
    How many of the 64 possible assignments of gray levels of two adjacent pixels satisfy the rule?
    A)24 B) 32 C) 34 D)40 E)64
        ANS: 34
        Explanation:
            https://stackoverflow.com/q/61337148/5618475
            Basically, you have 2 pixels, every pixel can be any number from 0 to 7 (that's 8 different possibilities). 
            There are 8x8 = 64 combinations in total. However, your problem gives an additional limitations, 
            that the pixel values cannot be too far apart, which renders some of the combinations valid and some of the combinations invalid.

            You just have to count how many are valid.

            For example, take the first pixel of value 0 -- the other pixel cannot be any value from 0 to 7, just only 0, 1 and 2 (because 3-0 > 2).
            Apply the similar chain of the reasoning for the other possible values.

            Let the left digit represent the left pixel and right digit represent right pixel.
            Now we can plot, for each value of left digit (between 0 - 7), the value of right digit,
            should not be greater than or less than 2 and must also be between (0 - 7).

            00 01 02
            10 11 12 13
            20 21 22 23 24
               31 32 33 34 35
                  42 43 44 45 46
                     53 54 55 56 57
                        64 65 66 67
                           75 76 77

            another way of representation would be:
                0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
            0   x   x   x

            1   x   x   x   x

            2   x   x   x   x   x

            3       x   x   x   x   x

            4           x   x   x   x   x

            5               x   x   x   x   x

            6                   x   x   x   x

            7                       x   x   x

            A simple mathematics would be: 
            -   We have 8*8 total combinations for 2 pixels.
            -   Now we need 5*8 - 3*2 combinations to satisfy current constraints.
                2*3 => total 3 combinations (0, 1 or 2) differing from 


   - From given list (0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5) which number can be written as perfect representation of 2?
        ANS: 0.5, we can represent 0.5 as square root of a number.

    - Husband always tells the truth. Husband guesses a number between 1 and 1000. For each number's guess made by wife,
    husband tells wife yes/no. What is the worse case number of guesses wifi can take, before arriving at right number?
        ANS: 999 (since 1000th number will be actual number).

    - Given a function as below (written based on what I remember, pretty sure g(x) could be slighty wrong), 
    what is the complexity of the function f(x) for given input x.
    class foo{
        int f(x){
            if(x<1) return 1;
            return g(x)+f(x-1)
        }
        int g(x){
            if(x<1) return x/2;
            return g(x/2)+f(x/2);
        }
    }
        Options: Quadratic / Linear / Exponential / Logarithmic
        ANS: I think its Exponential, but I could be wrong.

    - given a function as below, what is the output of the function for func(2)?
    int func(x){
        if(x == 4) return 2;
        return 2*func(x+1);
    }
        ANS: func(2) = 2*func(3) = 2*2*func(4)=2*2*2 = 8

    - If there are two processes, accessing shared variables and are executing their steps automically. What is the output 
    of following program?
    | Program A | Program B |
    | int x = 1 | int y = 1 |
    | int a = y | int b = x |
        ANS: I think, there will be a deadlock. But I am not sure about steps being executed automically. The reason for deadlock is,
        Step 1, locks are acquired, x and y's values are updated, but since the locks are acquired, A will wait for lock of y and B will
        wait for lock of x, hence deadlock.
